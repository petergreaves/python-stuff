# This program prompts the user for a temperature.  It then calculates the root mean square
# deviation between a blackbody spectrum at the temperature and the measured data, and then
# reports the root mean square deviation value back to the user. The user can then enter either
# q to quit, or further guesses until a minimum value for the root mean square deviation value
# is found corresponding to the best fit temperature. On completion, the program plots the
# initial data points and a smooth blackbody curve for the best-fit temperature.
