# Write a program using Python that does the following:
#
# 1. Prompts the user to input the name of a particular isotope and its half-life,  Ï„, in seconds
# 2. Prompts the user for an initial amount of the isotope (in grams) and an elapsed time (in seconds).
# 3. Calculates the amount of the isotope remaining after this elapsed time and displays the result.
# 4. Calculates the initial mass of the isotope (in grams) necessary to ensure that, after half a minute, 5 grams of it remain, and displays the result. 5
# Plots the amount of the isotope remaining as a function of time, from elapsed time
# 6. The program should then
# repeat the instructions from step 1, until the user chooses to halt the program.
# 7. When the user wishes to enter no more isotopes, the program should display the decay plots for all of the isotopes that were entered, in a single
# plot, and print out a list of all the isotopes studied.
